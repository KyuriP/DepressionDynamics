# Computational Modeling of Depression Dynamics

This repository contains the analysis scripts and figures used in the paper: 
**"The Individual- and Population-level Mechanistic Implications of Statistical Networks of Symptoms"**  

## Overview

The study explores the mechanisms driving depressive symptom dynamics using a computational model based on network theory. It links mechanistic symptom networks with empirical data and examines how resilience affects symptom interactions. The project provides insights into bistability, hysteresis, and the evolution of statistical networks under different resilience scenarios.
